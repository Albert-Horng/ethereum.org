            <p>
              Ethereum is participating in the W3C Payments Group (see <a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/wpig/2015/02/19/web-payments-ig-meeting-in-utrecht-getting-my-feet-wet-and-moving/">www.w3.org/blog/wpig/2015/02/19/web-payments-ig-meeting-in-utrecht-getting-my-feet-wet-and-moving/</a>) with a view to making sure that the ongoing standardization work keeps open space in the specs for current and future work on non-repudiatable payments, cryptocurrencies and even smart contracts. The W3C Payments Group is a moderately large, diverse working group with a variety of interests from the technology, finance and fintech sectors, with a strong interest in user privacy and security. These are primary goals of the group because there are the areas where the web's current payment solutions are weakest: large scale credit card fraud is a major driver here. We anticipate further involvement in the group will be fruitful and productive. We are still learning how the W3C standards process works, it's a complex organization with lots of history, but we hope to be able to make sure that future specs in this area are supportive of our needs and the needs of other players in the cryptocurrency and cyberfinance space.
