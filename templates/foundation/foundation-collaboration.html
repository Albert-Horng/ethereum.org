            <p>
              The Ethereum Foundation is participating in and contributing, both financially and with the active involvement of our members, to a number of efforts involved in legal and regulatory outreach for the benefit of the cryptocurrency space. We proudly support the <a href="https://coincenter.org/">Coin Center</a>, a non-profit organization based in Washington dedicated to researching the legal implications of cryptocurrency and engaging in policy advocacy efforts, as well as other efforts that will soon be revealed.
