			Contracts are the main building blocks of Ethereum. A contract is a computer program that lives inside the distributed Ethereum network and has its own ether balance, memory and code. Every time you send a transaction to a contract, it executes its code, which can store data, send transactions and interact with other contracts.

			Contracts are maintained by the network, without any central ownership or control. Contracts are written in languages instantly familiar to any programmer and powered by Ether, Ethereum's cryptofuel. You can find out more in our wiki.

			Ethereum can be used to codify, decentralize, secure and trade just about anything: voting, domain names, financial exchanges, crowdfunding, company governance, contracts and agreements of most kind, intellectual property, and even smart property thanks to hardware integration.
